# Lane-Detection-CV

Simple lane detection using open cv. The lane detection of self driving cars brought my attention watching a couple of videos where an algorithm like this was implemented. The video used can be downloaded here: https://streamable.com/ly6gj. The lane detection uses the simple but quite useful openCV functions "CannyEdges" and "HoughLines" to detect and draw the lanes.
The algorithm uses mainly the difference of contrast between the lanes and the road so it won't work in many cases.
The code is free to use as I used for learning.
